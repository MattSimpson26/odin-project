# The Odin Project

This repository contains the coding exercises and projects that I completed as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). Each directory contains another readme with information behind each project, code snippets of my solution and what I learnt by undertaking these projects, as well as links to websites and videos that I found useful.
